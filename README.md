# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Features

(W.I.P : we should structure it better on friday, now its just random notes to remember specific features we might otherwise forget during the presentation)

- When the user buys a ticket, half its cost is given to the event's cashprize
- Streamers and commentators ticekts are free
- Roles other than spectator and player must be set by a maanger. Someone creating an account in that regard must take the third role
